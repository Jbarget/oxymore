    "wings": "He came to a halt just in front of the red door and stood there looking at it.  <i>Yes, you’re going in</i>, then just before making his way through, he grabbed the last of his beer and finished the remains in a single gulp. So this was the moment it all came to, Madrid under the dark of night, and every minute spent on the train up from his little town in Toledo led to this. He zipped tight the backpack where he kept his things safe and then pushed the door open with one hand, his fingernails painted electric blue on the journey up, and as it swung open he heard the music and the faint lights as the shadows swallowed him. The rhythm played out, <i>bang, bang, bang</i>, and Gabriel stood still taking in the bar before him. A girl in a beret, her friend whose hair was combed back and was sporting a phenomenal geometric pendant dangling from his ear, two girls with hair to their waists stood kissing in the corner, and here he was over yonder hidden under his coat, wanting so much to dance. <i>You’ve come alone</i>, he had come alone, this was his first time out and his feet were moving, Gabriel was so shy that he was trying to hold the rhythm inside all the while butterflies flew around his stomach and goosebumps ran down his fingertips and thighs from pure excitement. </br></br> Gabriel took off his coat. He had changed in the bathroom at the station because the train journey in was long and he couldn’t be sure he wouldn't run into someone he knew, <i>where did you crawl out of Gabriel</i>, and underneath the coat was his open leather jacket showing his bare torso, and a pair of leather pants he had picked up in a second hand shop which hung loose at the hip. Gabriel’s wavy hair bounced as he moved into the centre of the room. The rhythm sounded and red lights blinkered all around, now turning blue, gold, sparkling throughout as the sound went bang, bang, bang. From the friend with the earring to the girls kissing, everybody looked at him because Gabriel was a Grecian artwork, a student in Paris, that disinterested yet intriguing kind of allure, strong features on pale skin, and the red eyeshadow he had on all made him look like some marble figure. <i>This all seems like a film</i> said the girl in the beret. She wasn't wrong. Maybe it was for the poster covered walls, the drink in his hand, or his heart pounding wildly inside his chest, and <i>you’re going to wait here, you will wait here</i>, and how good it felt and oh how he loved himself being here in this space, so many beautiful things and a tornado raging in the pit of his stomach. Yes this was a film, he felt it in his skin. </br></br> Someone shouted into the microphone and the music stopped. There was a silence like the emptiness of the space and everyone turned towards the small stage where an amazonian figure appeared. Gabriel looked on stunned. Their skin was dark with a large silhouette and long legs, a shawl of golden beads covered their face while the rest of their body was naked bar a pair of tights which pulled firm at the waist, and gold necklaces swinging at the chest. Their long arms were covered in black feathers, their golden nails pointed like talons and when they began to sing they raised their arms and like beating wings waved them up and down. They stood there the image of some legendary, mythical bird, giant and ever so elegant, from their throat rang a deep voice singing as their arms were flying, their legs twisted with the tights pulling at their waist to form a slender outline, so defined, so sculpture like in its entirety, Gabriel looked and Gabriel thought <i>how beautiful, how gorgeous, who is this</i>. </br></br> <i>Banshee</i>, said the girl in the beret. Gabriel was looking at Banshee and Banshee at Gabriel, they removed the beads from their face and stared at him through the makeup and the sequins covering their eyes. Banshee was a phoenix, a creature like none Gabriel had ever seen before. He watched and danced while listening to their voice, he stretched his fingers moving them towards the ceiling, swaying from side to side, Banshee swayed to and fro, and Gabriel swayed from side to side, to and fro, both singing to each other, because <i>I have never seen anyone like you</i>, and the heat made him sweat between his leather pants where salty droplets ran down his round thighs. Under the changing light, Gabriel looked like a heavenly angel fallen to hell below, the most gorgeous, most lost of them all. From his innocence emanated a tragic magnetism, before him was Banshee unruly, and dangerous, <i>my wings are beating and I am looking at you</i>. </br></br>They continued moving and sweating until the song ended then Banshee left and Gabriel went into the bathroom. He stood there staring at himself in the mirror with the red makeup framing his eyes and he saw Banshee pass behind him. Banshee stood eye level at his back, eyes black and lips large, Gabriel turned and to look at them in that instant noticed nothing more than the fact that their lips were almost touching. He threw himself at Banshee. He couldn’t help it, and why should he, because now he had Banshee between his hands, he had his mouth to theirs, and against his fingers he felt the supple skin of their feather covered back with his body pressed to theirs. His skin felt so warm between the pair of them. Gabriel was entirely overcome by the situation and grabbed Banshee by their narrow hips lifting them up against the door. From there he worked his way down their body, down the beaded necklaces and beautiful, smooth chest, and Banshee had small nipples and let out a moan when he played with them, he could see from what was going on between Banshee’s tights that they were liking it, and Banshee had their back against the door, hands raised high, the light framed them from above, their crown of long tight curls fell to their shoulders when Gabriel grabbed their waist between both hands, in a sudden movement he ripped apart Banshee’s tights with his blue painted nails. Now there it was in front of him, Banshee’s cock, large like him, Gabriel staring at it hard in front of him before he pounced. He took their cock between his lips and Banshee moaned from above grabbing Gabriel by his hair drawing their hand down the nape of his neck and to Gabriel’s heart shaped lips, his hands on Banshee’s waist and both their hips moving together with the music bang, bang, bang. </br> </br>In total splendor Banshee looked down at Gabriel with his eyes, blue, green, grey, and speckled like the galaxies they stared at him as he bit at their thigh and the bones of their hips, and on his neck was a golden choker, now Banshee moved towards him. Crouched on the floor, his mouth against theirs, he took their face between both hands and stroked it, Banshee’s legs fixed into place between his and they began to wank him off. Gabriel did the same to Banshee. Then on the floor with a hand round their cock and a hand around his cock and with their knee they pressed between his ass cheeks and Banshee moaning in his ear, <i>your golden choker, your dangling necklaces, your hair against mine and your forehead against mine</i>, and with their fingers Banshee followed the outline of those heart shaped lips, <i>moan into my hands, Gabriel</i> and Gabriel groaned as Banshee wanked him, putting their fingers in his mouth, their fingers on his nipple, and him twisted in fear and innocence, <i>your candidness slips between my fingertips</i>, Banshee the mythological bird, dark skinned and covered in feathers, then between the rhythm of the music their dark eyes gazed, because Gabriel could only see the sequins and taste the flavour of Banshee’s mouth and he felt like a sci-fi hero, because. </br></br> - As though I were in a dream, you stoop over me, and then between golden beads, those sequined eyes with which you look at me stab me in the darkness. </br></br> - You're a poet.</br></br> - Yes. </br></br> What difference does it make if they were talking, Banshee balanced on top of him. One was innocence the other danger and they were both these things, both were the contrary, and all things, and his eyes like two galaxies and their fat lips between sequins, they kept wanking each other off on the floor, each groaning into the other’s ears and neck until they began to quiver. In the darkness of the bar in Malasaña, between the red and green and blue lights and the dreams of science fiction, his skin so pale and theirs so dark, the busted leggings and leather pants lowered to the knee, and his round ass in Banshee’s hands, they both came. Just like that, one over the stomach of the other, they ran their hands along each others' waists, and now they were as sweat and sticky cum, and they sat there face to face. They were kissing. The danger and the innocence, novelty and experience, two souls in the end constructed as identity. </br></br> - I have never seen anyone like you.</br></br>  I’ve never seen anyone like you either. </br></br> They stood silent for some time. </br></br> The music going bang, bang, bang. Until they began to speak.</br></br>"
